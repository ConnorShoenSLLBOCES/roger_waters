            <h2>Roger's Mom</h2>
                <p class="red">“My mum sat me down and said, ‘Now listen, you’re going to be faced with many naughty problems during your life, Roger. And when you are, here’s my advice: Read, read, read. Find out everything you can about whatever it is. Look at it from all sides, all angles, listen to all opinions, especially ones you don’t agree with it. Research it thoroughly, and when you’ve done that, you will have done all the heavy lifting and the next bit is easy.’ Is it? Ok, mum. What’s the easy bit? ‘Oh, the easy bit is, you just do the right thing.’"</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>America</h2>
                <p class="orange">"The United States has such an opportunity to be a leader in the world, and that opportunity has been frittered away."</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>Us and Them</h2>
                <p class="yellow">"There is no 'us' and 'them'; it's an illusion. We are all human beings, and we all have a responsibility to support one another and to discover ways of wresting the power from the very, very few people who control all the cash and all the property."</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>In a Competition</h2>
                <p class="green">"I'm in competition with myself and I'm losing."</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>War</h2>
                <p class="blue">"War is hugely profitable. It creates so much money because it's so easy to spend money very fast. There are huge fortunes to be made. So there is always an encouragement to promote war and keep it going, to make sure that we identify people who are 'others' whom we can legitimately make war upon."</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>Unfeeling World</h2>
                <p class="indigo">"Not the torturer will scare me, nor the body's final fall, nor the barrels of death's rifles, nor the shadows on the wall, nor the night when to the ground the last dim star of pain, is hurled but the blind indifference of a merciless, unfeeling world."</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>Resiisting the Regeme</h2>
                <p class="purple">"We live in very volatile times. And it is super necessary that all of us resist this move toward the militarization and establishment of a more and more authoritarian regime, not just in the United States but in Europe and elsewhere."</p>
