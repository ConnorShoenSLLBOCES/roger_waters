            <h2>The Bassist for an Iconic Band</h2>
                <p class="red">Roger Waters was the bassist for Pink Floyd (My favorite band) until 1985, when he left the band. He was the lead in most songs, occasionally switching out with guitarist David Gilmour as the lead. He wrote most of the lyrics for their songs. Syd Barret was the lead before his diparture due to mental health, he would write most songs for the band's first album, 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn.'</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>Legal Disputes</h2>
                <p class="orange">After a meeting sometime before his leaving the band, Roger left thinking Floyd was over, while David, Rick, and Nick all thought the band would continue. Roger left in 1985, where he told the others that they couldn't use the name Pink Floyd anymore, even legal action was taken against the others to prevent the use of the name. Roger lost this case and regrets ever taking the legal action.</p>
                    <br>
            <h2>Solo Music</h2>
                <p class="yellow">Roger has made solo music ever since his diparture from Floyd. His first solo album was 'The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking', which wasn't extremely successfull. He never really took off in his solo career, but he made music he enjoyed making, and is enjoyable to listen to. 'Radio K.A.O.S.', 'Is This The Life We Really Want?', and 'Roger Waters: The Wall' are all great listens. The first two being political concept albums, while the other is a live album of the iconic 'The Wall' album.</p>
